    <h1>Website Critque </h1>
    <h2> Website 1 <a href = "https://www.pennyjuice.com/"> Penny juicy</a></h2>
    <p>The first website I decided to Critque is called Penny Juice. The website is about juice that is made for kids but it isn't exactly designed very well. 
    For example the font. The font on this website is not centered properly and its margins are off making it very displeasing to the eye. It also reltates to the article we read because of its consistency. 
    Consistency on this webpage is not well thought out you have a lot of color changes and it seems to use a mix of soft colors and then add random bold colors so doesn't keep to the same color palette.
     My last issue with this website is the bar at the top of the screen. The bar moves oddly while scorlling through the website it scrolls with you but doesn't stay in the same postion making an odd see through box above the bar. </p>
    
     <h2>Website 2 <a href = "https://www.zappos.com/c/shoes?utm_source=google&utm_medium=sem_g&utm_campaign=436619660&utm_term=kwd-487276963&utm_content=__iv_p_1_g_32169737540_c_112878050180_w_kwd-487276963_n_g_d_c_v__l__t__r__x__y__f__o__z__i__j__s__e__h_1015431_ii__vi__&zap_placement=&_ivgu=4f97d443-4b4a-41d5-a4ff-6bf0488cc576"> Zappos</a></h2>
    <p> This website is all about shoes but its a bit too much.In this website I wanted to point out the convention about the wall of text. Although this website doesn't have walls upon walls of text their search convention is annoying. I found that this website has bad search. 
    In this case the bad search correlates to the over the top search bar. 
    It overwhelms you with options and draws away your attention which causes problems.
     The search menu should be a lot more simplified making it not a bad website but too busy. </p>
    <h2> Website 3 <a href = "https://revealize.com/8-ugly-websites-and-how-to-fix-them/"> Top 8 Ugly Websites</a></h2>
    <p> This is actually the website I got my first ugly website that I critqued on. I wanted to include this website beacuse of its very appealing to the eyes.
        I found in this website that once you enterted the website and started scrolling the side menus and options gradually appeared on the screen.
         I never seen this element in another website and I really enjoyed the effort they put in to adding this detail. Altough this website is visually appealing what I didn't like about it is the image boxes next to each title of the website. 
         I believe that there were supposed to be images next to each website but the image is not visible which took away from it's visual quality. 
         Relating this back to the top 10 mistakes in a webpage this would fall under "Not Answering The Users Questions". 
         Because, on a webpage dedicated to showing bad websites shouldn't you have visible images of said websites! 
         Concluding that the webpage does not answer the question of what a bad webpage looks like and making users click out and see the website themselves. 
         Which adds on another mistake. The mistake of "Opening new browser windows". 
         This creates a lack of usability and extra tabs a user does not want.
    </p>
    <h2> Website 4 <a href = "https://www.headspace.com/?%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&lpurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.headspace.com%3Fgclsrc%3Daw.ds%26&~ad_set_id=68065219102&~campaign_id=1919439341&~channel=g&~keyword=headspace&~placement&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1vSZBhDuARIsAKZlijS_BVUZLCC6xQsSk7sznpjgnaT2y7F9UQx7sIQXEL4qmLZ67x7xxQMaAjRAEALw_wcB&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1vSZBhDuARIsAKZlijS_BVUZLCC6xQsSk7sznpjgnaT2y7F9UQx7sIQXEL4qmLZ67x7xxQMaAjRAEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&%24web_only=true&_branch_match_id=832422530339698272&utm_source=Google%20AdWords&utm_medium=paid%20advertising&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA72Q3W6CQBSEn2a5K8hPQZpsGkRMjLQJWpuGm82R3fK3wtajXfTpC174CE3Ozcxk8p1MdT4rfLGsSgBHBYV40uJgglKmrLvWEhYoXM%2FDHt%2F54ZU4nqsosLLvSykYcN2fOBqjDVLDFRkXQk09%2Bg0ShSHV5SRpNSGIGxFnNZ7W2nzAzKI%2FEndVFhJPBXGXoE2OxPENEiTAGYozqzn15zP%2F2bFDe%2BZMQQFHBXXZTdFohp4bup59TyroOiFpOYlWXKf36ANmjJixEjezTZw12v7d5YtqeYm2a4w2uaybHVt87vM0jv0hw10b4K1TTdnBh3MNVuE%2BGwJcZ19J6v0c09wPhmAYsjeImm2URKlmulj8E2Ici96n%2BgOQknAJvgEAAA%3D%3"> Headspace </a> </h2>
    <p> Headspace is actually a website I use often because it is one of my benefits from work. 
        This website is again very visually appealing and seems to dodge most of the common webpage mistakes in Nailsons article. 
        But, I noticed a couple flaws in the website. 
        First is when you enter the website you are immeditaley met with a payment option of what heapspace plan you want to buy. 
        This isn't a common webpage mistake but I think if they changed there layout to be more information based to start so that users can understand what they are purchasing first instead of the other way around it would invoke more attention on their service they offer.
        The other mistake I noticed was the arrows by the payment plan option. The arrows give the illusion you can scroll through the options of headspace clicking on them but, they don't actually work. 
        Although I do enjoy this website and think it is very well designed this would fall under on of the top ten mistakes. 
        The mistake is "Violating User Conventions". 
        This mistake I put under this reason because it causes usability issues by immitating arrows you can click to view your options but actually being fake buttons on the screen.</p>
